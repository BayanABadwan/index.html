<h1> SPONGEBOB</h1>
<P> SpongeBob is a sea sponge who lives with his pet snail, Gary, in a fully furnished, two bedroom pineapple in the town of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob's dream in life is to be the ocean's ultimate fry cook, and thanks to his job flipping Krabby Patties at the Krusty Krab, he lives that dream every day. SpongeBob is as optimistic and earnest as a sea-dwelling sponge gets, but he can't seem to avoid getting himself, and usually everyone else around him, into trouble. While trying too hard, he tends to do things wrong...really wrong…which usually spells “disaster”. However, SpongeBob's always looking on the bright side of life; his enthusiasm and curiosity about the world make him downright irresistible</P>
